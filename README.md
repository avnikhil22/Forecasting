# Forecasting
(FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES ONLY)

The dataset was taken from this website https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/

The purpose of this forecasting is to understand the rise in global surface temperature by 2 degrees celsius
The dataset did not account for measurement errors like
Sea-surface temperature
Temperature of the polar caps
Temperature where human habitation is not possible

Analysis:
Logarithmic transformation and unit root tests were performed
Detrended the data 
Analysis was done using Seasonal autoregressive and moving average (SARIMA) and Vector autoregression (VAR) models
Model estimation was based on AIC and BIC values
Model accuracy was based on the lowest Mean squared error values
